            <p>Hello my name is Joaquin, the 18-year-old founder of a popular bus station website. My passion for snowboarding  and sking led me to create a user-friendly platform that connects people with bus stations and schedules in Boise.  My website has become a go-to resource for younger people who are  seeking reliable and up-to-date information on when buses will arive to take them to the mountain. I really like being able to help other kids who might not be able to go and enjoy snowboarding it really has been fun for me to countinue working on this website and I hope to countinue helping others as I move forward. If you have any problems with the website you can send me a email at joaquinmthomas@gamil.com Thank you for visting my website.</p>
